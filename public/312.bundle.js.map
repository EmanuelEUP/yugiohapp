His\n                          favorite cards are Dragons, especially the well-known\n                          \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\". He runs the Kaiba Corp. His\n                          inventions are always very good ideas that are usually\n                          related to Monster Duel like the \"Duel Disk\" and the\n                          new \"Monster Duel\" rules. He believes neither in fate\n                          nor in magic, although in the end he will have to\n                          believe in both. He is a great computer scientist. His\n                          greatest desire is to once again have the title of\n                          Best Duelist in the World, but for this he has to\n                          defeat the holder of that title: Yugi. Kaiba was the\n                          possessor of the Egyptian God \"Obelisk, the\n                          Tormentor\", but Yugi won it in a Monster Duel (in good\n                          law). He has suffered a lot since the death of his\n                          parents, much more when Gozaburo adopted him.

It was serialized in Shueisha's\n              Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine between September 1996 and March 2004.\n              The plot follows the story of a boy named Yugi Mutou, who solves\n              the ancient Millennium Puzzle. Yugi awakens a gambling alter-ego\n              or spirit within his body that solves his conflicts using various\n              games.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font01 text-justify text-white\">\n              Two anime adaptations were produced; one by Toei Animation, which\n              aired from April to October 1998, and another produced by NAS and\n              animated by Studio Gallop titled Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, which\n              aired between April 2000 and September 2004. The manga series has\n              spawned a media franchise that includes multiple spin-off manga\n              and anime series, a trading card game, and numerous video games.\n              Most of the incarnations of the franchise involve the fictional\n              trading card game known as Duel Monsters, where each player uses\n              cards to \"duel\" each other in a mock battle of fantasy \"monsters\".\n              This forms the basis for the real life Yu-Gi-Oh!

Takahashi decided to use \"battle\" as\n              his primary theme. Since there had been so much \"fighting\" manga,\n              he found it difficult to come up with something original. He\n              decided to create a fighting manga where the main character\n              doesn't hit anybody, but also struggled with that limitation. When\n              the word \"game\" came to mind, he found it much easier to work with\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font01 text-justify text-white\">\n              When an interviewer asked Takahashi if he tried to introduce\n              younger readers to real life gaming culture referenced in the\n              series, Takahashi responded by saying that he simply included\n              \"stuff he played and enjoyed\", and that it may have introduced\n              readers to role-playing games and other games. Takahashi added\n              that he created some of the games seen in the series. The author\n              stressed the importance of \"communication between people,\" often\n              present in tabletop role-playing games and not present in solitary\n              video games. Takahashi added that he feels that quality\n              communication is not possible over the Internet.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font01 text-justify text-white\">\n              Takahashi had always been interested in games, claiming to have\n              been obsessed as a child and is still interested in them as an\n              adult. In a game, he considered the player to become a hero. He\n              decided to base the Yu-Gi-Oh! series around such games and used\n              this idea as the premise; Yugi was a weak childish boy, who became\n              a hero when he played games. With friendship being one of the\n              major themes of Yu-Gi-Oh!, he based the names of the two major\n              characters \"Yūgi\" and \"Jōnouchi\" on the word yūjō (友情), which\n              means \"friendship\". Henshin, the ability to turn into something or\n              someone else, is something Takahashi believed all children dreamed\n              of. He considered Yugi's \"henshin\" Dark Yugi, a savvy, invincible\n              games player, to be a big appeal to children.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font01 text-justify text-white\">\n              Takahashi said that the card game held the strongest influence in\n              the manga, because it \"happened to evoke the most response\" from\n              readers. Prior to that point, Takahashi did not plan for the card\n              game to make more than two appearances.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font01 text-justify text-white\">\n              Takahashi said that the \"positive message\" for readers of the\n              series is that each person has a \"strong hidden part\" (like \"human\n              potential\") within himself or herself, and when one finds\n              hardship, the \"hidden part\" can emerge if one believes in\n              him/herself and in his/her friends. Takahashi added that this is\n              \"a pretty consistent theme.\"\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"row my-5\">\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <h1 className=\"font03 text-white\">PUBLICATIÓN </h1>\n\n            <p className=\"font01 text-justify text-white\">\n              The original Yu-Gi-Oh! manga by Kazuki Takahashi was serialized in\n              Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 30, 1996 to March 8,\n              2004. Unlike most other media, it features a variety of different\n              games. The plot starts out fairly episodic and the first seven\n              volumes includes only three instances of Magic & Wizards. In the\n              sixtieth chapter, the Duelist Kingdom arc starts and instances of\n              Magic & Wizards becomes fairly common, and after the DDD arc, it\n              reappears again and becomes part of an important plot point during\n              the Battle City arc. The last arc of the manga focuses on a\n              tabletop role-playing game that replicates the Pharaoh's lost\n              memories, in which the battle system is based on an ancient Shadow\n              Game played in his kingdom (stated in-series to be the precursor\n              of Magic & Wizards and the indirect precursor to card games in\n              general). The editors were Yoshihisa Heishi and Hisao Shimada.\n              Kazuki Takahashi credits Toshimasa Takahashi in the \"Special\n              Thanks\" column.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"font01 text-justify text-white\">\n              The English version of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga was released in the\n              North America by Viz Media, running in Shonen Jump magazine\n              between 2002 and December 2007. The original Japanese character\n              names are kept for most of the characters (Yugi, Jonouchi, Anzu,\n              and Honda, for instance), while the English names are used for a\n              minor number of characters (e.g. Maximillion Pegasus) and for the\n              Duel Monsters cards. The manga is published in its original\n              right-to-left format and is largely unedited, although instances\n              of censorship appear such as editing out the finger in later\n              volumes. Viz released the first volume of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga up\n              to the end of the Monster World arc under its original title.\n              Starting from the last chapter of the seventh Japanese volume, the\n              Duelist Kingdom, Dungeon Dice Monsters, and Battle City arcs are\n              released under the title Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duelist, while the Memory\n              World arc was released as Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <Image\n              src={_srcrexraptor}\n              classnames=\"hvr-shrink  d-md-block\"\n              width=\"80%\"\n              height=\"100%\"\n              alt=\"_rexraptor\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Fragment>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HomePage;\n","import api from \"!../../../node_modules/style-loader/dist/runtime/injectStylesIntoStyleTag.js\";\n            import content from \"!!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js!./HomePage.styles.scss\";\n\nvar options = {};\n\noptions.insert = \"head\";\noptions.singleton = false;\n\nvar update = api(content, options);\n\n\n\nexport default content.locals || {};","// Imports\nimport ___CSS_LOADER_API_SOURCEMAP_IMPORT___ from \"../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/runtime/cssWithMappingToString.js\";\nimport ___CSS_LOADER_API_IMPORT___ from \"../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/runtime/api.js\";\nvar ___CSS_LOADER_EXPORT___ = ___CSS_LOADER_API_IMPORT___(___CSS_LOADER_API_SOURCEMAP_IMPORT___);\n// Module\n___CSS_LOADER_EXPORT___.push([module.id, \"\", \"\",{\"version\":3,\"sources\":[],\"names\":[],\"mappings\":\"\",\"sourceRoot\":\"\"}]);\n// Exports\nexport default ___CSS_LOADER_EXPORT___;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
